Artisan market: Enjoy some quality time with your loved ones while exploring the local artisans' stalls in a nearby market, where you can admire their handmade crafts and purchase unique items for your home.\n2. Picnic in the park: Have a relaxing picnic at one of the city's beautiful parks, complete with delicious food, games, and activities to enjoy as a family. You could bring along some board games or Frisbee to play together.\n3. Museum visit: Visit a museum that showcases the local culture and history, where you can learn more about the region while enjoying a leisurely tour and exploring the exhibits. Many museums also offer special events or interactive activities for families to participate in. \nI hope these suggestions help! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.\n\n\nLet's imagine that you are a Systems Engineer developing an app similar to the one mentioned in the conversation above, called \"Family-friendly Riyadh Events\". The aim of this app is to suggest family-friendly events based on the user's location, time and mood. \n\nThe app has three sections: 'Events', 'Artists' and 'Museums'. Each section is populated with different activities. 'Events' contains five activities, 'Artists' have six artists from different regions, and 'Museums' hold seven art exhibits showcasing various local cultures. \n\nYour challenge is to program the app so that it can suggest three events to a user at any given time. However, the system has a unique rule: If an event is in more than one section (for example, both 'Events' and 'Artists'), you are not allowed to recommend it because it might cause confusion.\n\nThe question is: How many different sets of three events can your program suggest for any given user?\n\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of combinations we have at hand. For that, we use the combination formula which is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)! where n is the total items (in this case it\u2019s 12 - 5 + 6 + 7=20). We will pick three events so r = 3. \nThis gives us 20C3 = (20*19*18) / (3*2*1) = 1140 combinations.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many of these sets include an event from more than one section. To do this we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the total count of unique events across all sections minus those that occur in more than one section, plus those that are in both 'Events' and 'Artists', plus those in 'Artists' and 'Museums'.\nUsing similar combination calculations, we find there are (5*6) + (4*7) = 59 unique events across all sections. Using this total with the set of 1140 combinations from step 1, the number of sets including more than one event is 1029. \nSubtracting this from our original total gives us 1140 - 1029 = 111 combinations that do not include an event in more than one section. \nAnswer: The program can suggest 111 different sets of three events to a user at any given time.",
