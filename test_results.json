Outdoor Movie Night - Set up a big screen and projector at a local park or community center. You can show classic family movies like \"Home Alone\" or \"The Lion King\".\n2. Museum Tour - Visit the National Museum of Saudi Arabia, which has an extensive collection of artifacts, artworks, and other historical items. It's perfect for learning something new with your kids while enjoying a rainy day indoors.\n3. Cooking Class - Enroll in a family-friendly cooking class where you can learn how to make traditional Saudi Arabian dishes like Basmati Rice or Shawarma. This will not only be educational but also a fun way to bond with your loved ones.\n\n\nThe Declic app is being used by three families (Family A, Family B, and Family C) in Riyadh. Each family has chosen one of the three event ideas: Outdoor Movie Night, Museum Tour, and Cooking Class. The following information is known:\n1. The museum tour isn't for either Family A or Family C.\n2. Family A doesn't choose the same activity as Family B. \n3. Family B decides to go on a different event than Family A.\n\nQuestion: Which family chooses which event?\n\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that neither Family A nor Family C is taking the Museum Tour. So it must be taken by either Family B or another unrelated family D. But since from clue 2, we know that Family A doesn't choose the same activity as Family B, and from clue 3, Family B also chooses a different event than Family A. It means that these two families should have chosen their events together.\nSo let's assign Family B to take the Museum Tour and another unrelated family D could be assigned to take the Cooking Class.\n\nWe know Family C can't have the museum tour from clue 1, so it must go for Outdoor Movie Night because Family A didn't choose the same activity as Family B (museum tour) and they didn't pick the Cooking Class which is taken by another unrelated family D (from step 1). \nThat leaves the Cooking class for Family A. This fits with our rule that no two families can have the same activity. Also, it fulfills all conditions given in the problem.\nAnswer: Family B chooses the Museum Tour, Family C chooses the Outdoor Movie Night and Family A chooses the Cooking Class.",
